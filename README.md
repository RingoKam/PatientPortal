# Patient Portal ðŸ’Š

## Project Description
Please create a responsive web application that will have an upload view that accepts CSV files with
patient records as input (see CSV sample file attached), and a view that displays the patients already
uploaded to the application with basic ordering and filtering by patient name. Once uploaded, each
patient record should be editable.

## Requirements
- Backend Web API written in .NET 6 C#.
- Frontend written in Angular 12 or higher.
- Data uploaded can be stored in SQL and should not be volatile (survive a restart).
- An online Git based repository accessible to clone and review the code.
